This is a minimal electronics enclosure that uses a power supply as a frame. The base configuration contains:
- Meanwell LRS350
- Fysetc S6
- Raspberry Pi 4
- 4010 axial fan
- 5015 blower fan

The idea here is that the simple design can be reconfigured to suit other components that fit on top of the PSU. Credit to Papejelly for the cable channels.
