# Split Rebreather

This mod of the rebreather is designed to be mounted under the bed of an Annex K3, or similar printer. It is intended to be used as a recirculating fan for quicker heatup times with the added benefit of cleaning the air.

Parts and assembly is basically the same as the original rebreather, with the exception of a few more screws for the bridges, more magnets for the cartridge and the grill. 

The grills will need to be sliced with 0 top and bottom layers and set the infill to your desired percentage (small enough to retain activated carbon). 

The mounts will require:
- 4x m5x10 SHCS
- 4x m5 drop in t-nuts

Wiring is routed through the mounts and down the middle extrusion.
