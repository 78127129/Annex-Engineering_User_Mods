# This is a remix of Churls' legendary Stiffy3 for the Ender 5 with a Dragonfly BMS hotend. 

The differences introduced with this remix are: 
- modification of the right side to fit the belt mounting of the Ender 5. 
- slight decrease in height due to the shorter height of the Dragonlfy BMS. 
- altered cutout for the Dragonfly BMS to fit into, including cutouts for thermistor and heater cables. 

In addition, there is an STL included for a mount of the [Annex Carabiner](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex_Engineering_PCBs/tree/master/carabiner-series-toolboard/carabiner) that fits perfectly behind the Sherpa Mini motor. 

The toolhead and Carabiner mount are mounted to the [Rear_Mounting_Plate_E5](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4945681) designed by BoothyBoothy. 

Most assembly steps are identical to the standard Stiffy3 and relatively straightforward. A few additional notes:

The metal crimp attached on the right side (viewed from front) needs to be pointing towards the back to make the right fan fit. 

The Dragonfly BMS has the heater and thermocouple cables on opposite sides of the nozzle (heater in front, thermistor in back). For the best routing, first feed the thermistor cable (from below) through the cutout hole of Stiffy, then the Dragonfly BMS. The heater cable then gets routed through the front cutout, held in place by the coldend cooling fan.
