This is an electronics box plate that incorporates 3 components:
    - USB extension, e.g. for quick connection of accelerometer MCU (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00S6HGY72/)
    - Ethernet (RJ45) coupler (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01JCKJ9MI/)
    - A pass through for connecting your PTFE tube from the outside; this uses the same hex shape as the one used on the Sherpa Mini for example

As all ebox plates, this one needs 4x M3 heatset inserts. Mounting hardware for USB and RJ45 came included with the ones I adapted it for, but can be replaced for other screw types.
