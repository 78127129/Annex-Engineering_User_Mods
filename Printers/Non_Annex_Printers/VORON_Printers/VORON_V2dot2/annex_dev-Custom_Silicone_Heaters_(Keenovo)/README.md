# Custom Heaters for VORON V1/V2
These were designed for the following reasons:
 - Eliminate the 3M Tape Bond, replace with RTV
 - Support Dual Voltage on the same heater
 - Add a jackscrew point in the center of the bed
 - Have insulation on the bottom of the heater to reduce heat leak into the electronics bay and surrounding, wasting energy.
 - Better cover the bottom of the bed for more even heating
 - Custom Fit to the bed to clear all mounting and fusing hardware
