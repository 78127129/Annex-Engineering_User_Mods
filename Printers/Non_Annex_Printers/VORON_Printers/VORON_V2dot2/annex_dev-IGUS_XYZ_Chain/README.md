# IGUS Chain Anchors for VORON V2.2
These were designed for the following reason:
 - Eliminate the 3D Printed Zip Chain Frustration
 
 This requires the following major purchases:
 - IGUS E2i-10 Chain x2 with Floating End Brackets on Both Sides
 - IGUS E2i-15 Chain x1 with Fixed End Brackets on Both Sides
 
 WARNING: 
  - IF YOU OVER FILL THESE CHAINS YOU WILL BREAK WIRES EXTREMELY QUICKLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE 26AWG FOR SIGNAL AND 22AWG FOR HEATERS IF YOU USE THESE.
  - USING SILICONE RIBBON CABLES CAN ALSO REDUCE THE LIFE OF THE WIRING, SINGLE WIRE IS RECOMMENDED BY IGUS IN THIS APPLICATION. THEY DO NOT APPROVE OF RIBBON CABLE USE IN CHAINS BEYOND SINGLE CABLE RUNS
  - EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF HITTING THE Z BELT WITH THE CHAIN, PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR WIRING
