# DirectDrive AB Drive for V2.2
These were designed for the following reasons:
 - Eliminate the 40$ stepdown
 - Reduce mechanical complexity
 - Remove useless dampers
 - Reduce printed part count, and thus failure points
 - Remove printed idler spacers
 
 This requires the following major purchases:
  - 12mm Longer Rear extrusion
  - 1mm M5 Shim Washers
  - 0.5mm M5 Shim Washers
  - 4x F695 Bearings
