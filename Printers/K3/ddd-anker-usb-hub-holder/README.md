# Holder for Anker (non-powered) USB hub
Inspired by karapox BTT relay holder. Attaches to the ebox corners, the m5 inserts should have enough thread to hold the panels and the usb holder. Hub is attached by zipties so it can point wherever you like, mine points at outside and there should be enough space to route the cable up a raspberry mounted on waveshare 7.9" lcd.
