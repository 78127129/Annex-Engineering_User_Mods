Note, all the hard work was done by GhettoMat.  All i did was rework his mount.  So thanks to him for figuring it all out.  

the stock screws version uses the screws that come with the camera and screw in from the back.

I happened to have 1.6mm screws, so that version works if you have 1.6mm screws (often used for glasses etc).  The 1.6mm screws go in from the front and screw into the plastic of the mount.

Don't forget to set your focus by spinning the lens.  I find it's easiest to do this with a piece of paper with text on it laying on the bed.

I used the cable_cover.stl to cover the wire going down in the extrusion channel.  Print the cable cover thing standing up.  I used a brim to keep it from knocking over.

make sure to get the "100 degree no distortion"


The Mount_Covered_Untested folder has a version I've been meaning to test, which has a cover.
