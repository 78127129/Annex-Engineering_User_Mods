# Universal mcu bracket from K3 repo but longer
  Allows vertical installation of fysetc spider 2.3 on the k3 among probably other mcus. uses the same hardware and gubbins as the one in the repo.

  recommend you add vhb or something between the brackets and panel to stop vibrations while printing.
