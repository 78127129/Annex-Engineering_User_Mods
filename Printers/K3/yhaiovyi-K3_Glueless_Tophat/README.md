# K3 Glueless Tophat

This mod allows you to build a tophat without using glue.


## Goals
- Reduce a posibility of a gluing misalignment
- Eliminate overhangs without any significant impact on material used

## BOM
- Sources for all items can be found in the [sourcing guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3eyVuQ6M4F03MJSDs4Z71_XyNjXL5HFTZr1jsaAtRc/htmlview#) in the K3 sheet.

| Item                                                             | Qty Required  |
| ---                                                              | ---           |
| M5 Brass Heat Stake Threaded Insert (Backpack corners leftovers) | 8             |
| M5 x 25mm to 40mm Button/Socket Head Cap Screw                   | 8             |
| Original tophat hardware                                         | 1             |

## Notes
- Assembly is pretty self-explanatory and similar to the original top hat. Except for bolts and heat stake inserts
- Please make sure to tune your plasic shrinkage rate. At scales like this even 99% rate leads to significant overall error
